# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Overview
Comprehensive GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline that tests Docker images before building and pushing to Docker Hub, with integrated Trivy security scanning.

## Key Components

### Test Workflow ([`.github/workflows/test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml))
- **Triggers:** PRs to master, pushes to master, version tags (v*), manual dispatch
- **Build:** Single-arch test image (linux/amd64)
- **Testing:** Runs comprehensive tests via [`build-and-test.sh`](build-and-test.sh)
- **Security:** Trivy security scanning (informational mode, exit-code: 0)
- **Reporting:** Uploads SARIF results to GitHub Security tab, generates human-readable reports (30-day retention)
- **Optimization:** Uses GitHub Actions cache (type=gha)

### Publish Workflow ([`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml))
- **Trigger:** `workflow_run` on successful test completion
- **Build:** Multi-arch images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- **Security:** Scans published images with Trivy (CRITICAL, HIGH severities)
- **Publishing:** Docker Hub (firbykirby/udp-broadcast-relay)
- **Tags:** Preserves latest, semver strategies

### Test Script ([`build-and-test.sh`](build-and-test.sh))
- **Enhancements:** `TEST_IMAGE` environment variable support, conditional build logic (skips if image exists in CI)
- **Compatibility:** All hardcoded image references replaced with `$IMAGE_TAG` variable
- **Output:** CI-friendly formatting, backward compatible for local testing

## Security Features
- Trivy vulnerability scanning integrated in informational mode
- Results visible in GitHub Security tab
- Won't block deployments initially
- Clear path to enable blocking mode in future
- Scans both test and published images

## Workflow Behavior
- **PRs:** Tests run, no publishing
- **Master pushes:** Tests run → if pass → publish automatically
- **Version tags:** Tests run → if pass → publish with semver tags
- **Manual dispatch:** Full test and publish cycle

## Technical Details
- **Action versions:** checkout@v4, buildx@v3, trivy@0.28.0, etc.
- **Permissions:** contents:read, security-events:write, packages:write
- **Concurrency:** Per-ref with cancel-in-progress
- **Cache strategy:** GitHub Actions cache (type=gha)

## Verification Status
- All configurations verified correct
- No critical issues found
- Two minor warnings: Trivy version pinning, potential duplicate runs
- Ready for deployment
