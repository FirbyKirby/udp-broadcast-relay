# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

## Overview
Refactored GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with dependency chain architecture that eliminates redundant testing and provides controlled release management through explicit version tags.

## Architecture Design
**Complete specification:** [`docs/WORKFLOW_DEPENDENCY_CHAIN_DESIGN.md`](docs/WORKFLOW_DEPENDENCY_CHAIN_DESIGN.md)

## Current State (As Designed - Pending Implementation)

### Three-Scenario Architecture

#### Scenario 1: Pull Request Merges to Main
- **PR Phase:** Tests run during pull request validation
- **Merge Phase:** NO tests run (already validated), NO auto-publish
- **Result:** 67% reduction in workflow runs, controlled releases

#### Scenario 2: Version Tags (v*)
- **Pipeline:** Sequential test → build → push → sync → release
- **Enforcement:** Tests must pass before publishing (job dependency)
- **Quality Gate:** Guaranteed tested code in all releases

#### Scenario 3: Manual Workflow Dispatches
- **Independence:** Test or publish can be triggered separately
- **Flexibility:** No automatic chaining, maximum control for maintainers

### Test Workflow ([`.github/workflows/test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml))

**Designed Triggers:**
- ✅ `pull_request: branches: ["main"]` - PR validation
- ✅ `push: branches: ["dev"]` - dev commits
- ✅ `workflow_dispatch` - manual testing
- ❌ **REMOVED:** `push: branches: ["main"]` - eliminates redundancy
- ❌ **REMOVED:** `push: tags: ["v*"]` - moved to docker-publish.yml

**Purpose:** Validates code during development and PR review only

**Jobs:**
- `test`: Builds test image (amd64), runs functional tests, Trivy security scan
- **Build:** Single-arch test image (linux/amd64)
- **Testing:** Runs comprehensive tests via [`build-and-test.sh`](build-and-test.sh)
- **Security:** Trivy vulnerability scanning with SARIF upload
- **Reporting:** GitHub Security tab integration, human-readable reports (30-day retention)
- **Optimization:** GitHub Actions cache (type=gha)

### Publish Workflow ([`.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml))

**Designed Triggers:**
- ✅ `push: tags: ["v*"]` - official releases only
- ✅ `workflow_dispatch` - manual publishing/documentation sync
- ❌ **REMOVED:** `workflow_run` - eliminates auto-publish on main merges

**Purpose:** Publishes production artifacts with full validation pipeline

**Jobs (Dependency Chain):**
1. **test** (NEW for tags)
   - Runs full test suite before publishing
   - Only executes for version tag pushes
   - Must pass before build-and-push
   
2. **build-and-push** (MODIFIED)
   - **Depends on:** `test` job success (for tags)
   - Builds multi-arch images (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
   - Pushes to Docker Hub
   - Trivy scan on published images
   
3. **sync-readme**
   - **Depends on:** `build-and-push` success
   - Syncs README.md to Docker Hub
   - Runs for tags and manual dispatch
   
4. **create-release**
   - **Depends on:** `build-and-push` success
   - Creates GitHub release with auto-generated notes
   - Only for version tags

### Test Script ([`build-and-test.sh`](build-and-test.sh))
- **Enhancements:** `TEST_IMAGE` environment variable support, conditional build logic
- **Compatibility:** All hardcoded image references use `$IMAGE_TAG` variable
- **Output:** CI-friendly formatting, backward compatible for local testing

## Key Benefits

### Resource Efficiency
- **Before:** Tests run twice per PR merge (PR + main push)
- **After:** Tests run once per PR merge (PR only)
- **Savings:** ~50% reduction in redundant CI minutes

### Controlled Releases
- **Before:** Every main merge triggers automatic publish
- **After:** Publishing only via explicit version tags
- **Benefit:** Accumulate multiple PRs before releasing

### Quality Assurance
- **Before:** Tag pushes could publish before tests complete (parallel)
- **After:** Tests must pass before publish (sequential dependency)
- **Guarantee:** All releases contain tested code

### Clear Intent
- **Before:** Implicit workflows via `workflow_run` trigger
- **After:** Explicit triggers per scenario
- **Benefit:** Easier to understand, debug, and maintain

## Security Features
- Trivy vulnerability scanning on test and published images
- SARIF results uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- Human-readable reports with 30-day retention
- Configurable severity levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- Non-blocking mode (exit-code: 0) with path to enforcement

## Workflow Behavior (Designed)

| Event | test.yml | docker-publish.yml | Result |
|-------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| **PR to main** | ✅ Runs | ❌ No | Validates only |
| **Merge to main** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Silent (already validated) |
| **Push to dev** | ✅ Runs | ❌ No | Development validation |
| **Push tag v*** | ❌ No | ✅ Full pipeline | test → build → publish → sync |
| **Manual test.yml** | ✅ Runs | ❌ No | Independent testing |
| **Manual docker-publish.yml** | ❌ No | ✅ Runs | Independent publishing |

## Technical Details
- **Action versions:** checkout@v4, buildx@v3, build-push-action@v6, trivy@0.28.0
- **Permissions:** contents:read/write, security-events:write, packages:write
- **Concurrency:** Per-ref groups, no cancel-in-progress for publish workflow
- **Cache strategy:** GitHub Actions cache (type=gha, mode=max)
- **Platforms:** Multi-arch support (amd64, arm64)

## Migration Status
- ✅ **Design Complete:** Full specification in [`docs/WORKFLOW_DEPENDENCY_CHAIN_DESIGN.md`](docs/WORKFLOW_DEPENDENCY_CHAIN_DESIGN.md)
- ⏳ **Implementation:** Pending (ready for Code mode)
- ⏳ **Testing:** 6 test scenarios defined
- ⏳ **Documentation Updates:** 4 files identified for updates

## Problems Solved

### Problem 1: Redundant Test Execution
- **Issue:** Tests ran twice (PR + main merge) for same commit
- **Solution:** Removed main push trigger from test.yml
- **Impact:** 50% reduction in test runs

### Problem 2: Unwanted Auto-Publishing
- **Issue:** Every main merge triggered automatic Docker publish
- **Solution:** Removed workflow_run trigger from docker-publish.yml
- **Impact:** Explicit release control via version tags

### Problem 3: Parallel Execution Risk
- **Issue:** Tag pushes ran test and publish in parallel (potential race)
- **Solution:** Sequential test → publish with job dependency
- **Impact:** Guaranteed tested releases

### Problem 4: Complex Conditional Logic
- **Issue:** workflow_run with complex event filtering
- **Solution:** Simple, explicit triggers per scenario
- **Impact:** Easier maintenance and debugging
